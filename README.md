The page we will be using is a test page. The only way it can work is having the program "webform.py" running at the same time as "main.py".
To see the page, you can do it visiting: http://localhost:8880/form from your browser. And then you can complete the form from the "main.py" program, that will do the same as
if we wrote it manually from the web page.
